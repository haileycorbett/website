My name is Hailey Corbett. I am 19 years old, and currently in my freshman year of college at Utah Valley University. My major is Digital Audio, though there is no harm in experimenting with other Adobe Suite programs, hence the diversity of my portfolio! Here, you can find my work from my classes as well as personal projects. Feel free to contact me with the information on the [contact me](/pages/contact-me) page with any questions!
