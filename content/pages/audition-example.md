In this podcast, I discuss sound queues in video games and how they can make playing complicated MMOs more feasible and accessible. In order to do this I had to record audio from Final Fantasy XIV (the game I discuss), and write a script that would allow me to fit each of these sound effects in. Personally listening to someone talking alone can sometimes be difficult, so I added a soundtrack from the video game to ease listenability. Iâ€™m proud of this for the sound quality, consistent levels, and the script.
