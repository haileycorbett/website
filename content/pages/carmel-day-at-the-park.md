This video documents a day at the park with my adorable dog, Carmel. Iâ€™m particularly fond of this project. In order to film, I used my iPhone 11 Pro with a Gimbal to remove the shakiness of my hands. The title as well as the end credits were titles that I designed in photoshop, using fonts and clip art I found online. Not only does the soundtrack highlight my adorable dog, but if you pay attention I did my best to match clips to the lyrics to make it all fit together a little better. I love this video for just how fun it was to make, and how I was able to share my sweet dog with the world.
