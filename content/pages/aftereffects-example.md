This animation I made using a tutorial from the YouTube channel [“AE Tutorials”](https://youtube.com/c/AETutorials007). It was very interesting to see just how complicated this program can get, and the level of detail you can get with it. I had to find a suitable logo for this project, and I wanted to find one that used words, so I ended up using the “DOOM” logo from the video game series Doom. I’m rather proud that I was able to do all this, though it wouldn’t have been possible without the help of that tutorial.
