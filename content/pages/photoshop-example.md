This was made for an assignment that called for me to make an album cover. This piece was very fun to make, trying to find a way to blend a cat’s fur into skin while making it look natural. I’m very proud of the techniques that I was able to incorporate, especially due to the fact I only had a small amount of experience in photoshop at the time.

This piece was made for an assignment that instructed me to create a scene where things that don’t belong, look like they belong. With inspiration from the music video for Coldplay’s “Up&Up”, I came up with the idea of windows that looked into different nature scenes. Precise masking and overlay options made this possible. Trying to make these seem as if they were a part of this apartment building was a challenge, though I’m very proud of the results.
