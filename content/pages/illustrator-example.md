This was made for an assignment that required me to make a low poly image. I had a lot of fun learning illustrator and wanted to put a lot of effort into my project. This image is a portrait of a character from the video game “VALORANT”, and what I did was trace each part of the image into triangles and individually fill in each triangle with color. This piece is probably one of my favorites.
